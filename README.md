# PSR-7
PSR-7: HTTP message interfaces implementation

Personal PSR-7 implementation, with added on validation of headers based on a given HTTP-version.

Uses ext-ds for storage, thisisboris\assertions for some type and data checks.

Built to be used in a specific application, I don't expect this to be used outside my own projects.
